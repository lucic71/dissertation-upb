\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:ccl}

State-of-the-art compilers, such as Clang/LLVM, use undefined behavior
to issue optimizations. However there is no study that presents exactly
what optimizations are used in Clang/LLVM and what their effects are on
various application categories. In this work we fill this gap by making
the necessary changes in the compiler to disable these optimizations.
Then we benchmark a diverse set of application categories compiled with
our compiler in order to assess the performance when the optimizations
are disabled. For the performance metrics, we focus on code speed and
code size.
