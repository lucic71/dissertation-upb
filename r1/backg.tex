\section{Background} \label{sec:bg}

This section starts with a short history of how compilers started to
take advantage of undefined behavior optimizations. Then we present some
of the most popular optimizations based on undefined behavior such as
signed integer overflow or null access. Finally, we talk about the
problem of benchmarking these optimizations on real-life software.
