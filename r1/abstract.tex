State-of-the-art compilers, such as Clang/LLVM, use undefined behavior
to issue optimizations. In this study, we explore the impact of
undefined behavior optimizations for a diverse set of application
categories. The results can be used by application developers who may
choose to disable certain such optimizations because they buy low
performance benefits or they are considered too dangerous. Furthermore
we present an extensive catalogue of all undefined behavior
optimizations that are used today.
