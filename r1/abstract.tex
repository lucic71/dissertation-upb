State-of-the-art compilers, such as GCC and Clang/LLVM, use undefined
behavior to issue optimizations. These optimizations may boost the
performance of specific classes of programs, such as High Performance
Computing. In contrast, other classes of programs, such as Operating
Systems, might not benefit from the performance advantages of undefined
behavior optimizations. In the latter case, disadvantages emerge in the
form of security vulnerabilities. In this study we analyze the
advantages and disadvantages of undefined behavior optimizations
for various classes of programs. To achieve this we take Clang/LLVM and
disable all undefined behavior optimizations. Then we analyze the
preformance impact for each class of application using suitable
benchmarks.
