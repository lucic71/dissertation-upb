Little work has been done in the area of detecting the performance
speedup of UB optimizations in real-life software projects. Wang et
al.~\cite{wang2012undefined} and Ertl~\cite{ertl2015every} provide
metrics for this class of optimizations based on SPECint benchmark.

Wang et al. state that they observed a decrease in performance of $7.2\%$
with GCC and $9.0\%$ with Clang for 456.hammer and $6.3\%$ with GCC and
$11.8\%$ with Clang for 462.libquantum. The experiments were conducted
with UB optimizations turned off.

Ertl states that with Clang-3.1 and UB optimizations turned on the
speedup factor is $1.017$ for SPECint 2006. Furthermore, for a specific
class of programs, i.e. Jon Bentley's traveling salesman problem, the
speedup factor can reach values greater than $2.7$ if the programmer
issues source-level optimizations by hand, surpassing the UB
optimizations issued by the compiler.
