\section{Conclusions and Further work}

In this semester we made significant progress on finding the impact of undefined
behavior optimizations. We continued the work from the past semester on
developing and exploring new flags that control the behavior of the compiler
with regards to exploitation of undefined behavior. We used Alive2 to find new
flags. We managed to find six more flags, resulting in 18 final flags that we
use in our benchmarking infrastructure.

We also started the performance experiments and solved issues regarding the
stability of the results. Use used techniques such as NUMA pinning and CPU
frequency lowering. This allowed us to have a deterministic and stable
envirnoment for our benchmarks.

Finally, we also started analysing the performance regressions and already found
hints of where the problem might lie in LLVM. However, we need to further analyze
the issues in order to provide fixs that can recover the initial performance.

In the next semester we plan to continue on analysing the performance regression
with the data that is available now. We also plan to run the benchmarks with
different optimization settings, such as -O3, -Os, -Oz. Finally, we plan to run
the benchmarks on AMD to see how it compares to current data from Intel and ARM.
