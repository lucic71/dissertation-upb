Clang/LLVM uses undefined behavior to issue optimizations. In this report, we
present the impact of this class of optimizations on a benchmarking suite built
using Phoronix. In this suite we focus on a diverse set of application
categories, ranging from compression algorithms and image processing to
web-servers and databases. To extensively cover the impact on these
applications, we provide 10 configurations that modify the behavior of the
compiler when exploiting undefined behavior in optimizations. Current results
show that in 90\% of cases the impact of undefined behavior optimizations is
insignificant.
