\todo{TODO LIST:
1. talk a little bit more about programmer intentionality to make it

2. talk about openbsd and how they are ready to accept compiler
modifications into the system (see how they disabled bluetooth,
hyperthreading, etc)
3. talk about why we conduct our tests on oses? because the primordial
role of c is to write oses
