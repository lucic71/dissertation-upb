State-of-the-art compilers, such as Clang/LLVM, use undefined behavior
(UB) to issue optimizations. In this poster session, we present the
impact of UB optimizations for a diverse set of application categories.
We use Phoronix to test this impact in the form of total execution time,
FPS, transactions per second, etc. With the recent proposal in the C++
Comittee of introducing errnoeous behavior (EB) as an alternative for
UB, the results can be used to better understand what behaviors should
be kept UB and what behaviors can be safely moved to EB based on
performance effects.
