State-of-the-art compilers, such as Clang/LLVM, use undefined behavior
to issue optimizations. In this poster session, we present the impact of
undefined behavior optimizations for a diverse set of application
categories. We use Phoronix to test the impact in the form of total
execution time, FPS, transactions per second, etc. The results can be
used by application developers who may choose to disable certain such
optimizations because they buy low performance benefits or they are
considered too dangerous.  \end{abstract}
